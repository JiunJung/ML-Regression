# ML-Regression

You can learn K-NN Regression, Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Multiple Regression, Ridge and Lasso.

Unlike classification, regression predicts "value" of the target. 

You can think regression as "function".

---------------

## K-NN Regression

K-NN regression predicts target using the "average of several close values".

Here are the result of prediction using K-NN Regression

This model predicts 50cm tall perch's weight as 1000g which is similar to 40~45cm tall perches.

Can you tell the problem of K-NN Regression algorithm?

The problem is, when the model predicts target, it just uses given data.

And we have to find another algorithm which finds the graph(function). So that, we could know the general tendency of the data.
